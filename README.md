# **Game Talk**
## **Site Overview**

As a big fan of Video Games i often find it hard to keep track of what games are out, coming out, popular etc. 

Game Talk is designed with the aim of creating a platform where everyone can share their games that they have played and talk about their experience and opinions about it. Users can create, read, update and delete game reviews which can be viewed by themselves and other users. The community experience comes from the ability to comment on games and reviews which then generates discussions about said games and creates a forum to interact and engange with others.

### **Wireframes**

I used Balsamiq Wireframes to help me with my design process for this project.

### **Database Schema**
I used [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/) to help visualise my database tables. See the image below:

### **Colour Scheme**
After researching various options for this project, I opted for the colour scheme below:
![Colour Palette](docs/images/colour-pallette.png)

I did not end up using all of the colours because i believe the site looks a lot more cleaner with a few less colours.

#### **Typography**

I researched a few different fonts that I thought would fit the sites theme. I eventually decided on:

*[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
I chose Roboto for its simplicity so the site is readible, also the font reminds of my text you see in Video Games which fits perfectly for the site.
