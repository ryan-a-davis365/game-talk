# **Game Talk**
## **Site Overview**

As a big fan of Video Games i often find it hard to keep track of what games are out, coming out, popular etc. 

Game Talk is designed with the aim of creating a platform where everyone can share their games that they have played and talk about their experience and opinions about it. Users can create, read, update and delete game reviews which can be viewed by themselves and other users. The community experience comes from the ability to comment on games and reviews which then generates discussions about said games and creates a forum to interact and engange with others.
