# **Game Talk**
## **Site Overview**

As a big fan of Video Games i often find it hard to keep track of what games are out, coming out, popular etc. 

Game Talk is designed with the aim of creating a platform where everyone can share their games that they have played and talk about their experience and opinions about it. Users can create, read, update and delete game reviews which can be viewed by themselves and other users. The community experience comes from the ability to comment on games and reviews which then generates discussions about said games and creates a forum to interact and engange with others.

<hr>

##### **EPIC 1 - Set up and Deployment:**

This epic will be tasks rather than user stories since they will be aimed at me as the developer rather than the user. The below tasks will be completed before the first sprint and will be used to set up the project and ensure that it is deployed to Heroku.

* As a **Developer** I can...
  * ...**Create a Git hub repository** so that I can **store my project files online.**
  * ...**Create a virtual environment on my local machine** so that I can **avoid polluting my machine on a global level.**
  * ...**Install Django and required libraries** so that I can **work with a postgress Database and cloudbased images from my local development IDE.**
  * ...**Set up my local coding environment** so that I can **develop on my local machine and deploy securely without revealing sensitive information.**
  * ...**Create a Heroku app** so that I can **link to the a virtually hosted Postgres database for the deployed site.**

The only user story in this Epic is related to the initial deployment; this is a user story rather than a task because it directly offers value to the user as opposed to being tasks required to create the project: -

* As a **User**, I can **access a live url** so that I can **use the site on any device.**

##### **EPIC 2 - Viewing and Navigation:**

* As a **Site User** I want to be able to...
  * ...**Read about the site** so that I can **understand the sites purpose.**
  * ...**View paginated list of posts** so that I can **select which post I want to view.**
  * ...**View individual posts** so that I can **select a post in particular i want to read.**

##### **EPIC 3 - Sorting and Searching:**

* As a **Site User** I want to be able to...**
  * ...**Search for a product by name** so that I can **find a specific post I'd like to view.**

##### **EPIC 4 - Registration and User Accounts:**

* As a **Site User** I want to be able to...
  * ...**Register an account** so that I can **comment on a post.**
  * ...**View my profile** so that I can **edit or delete posts.**

##### **EPIC 5 - Posts:**

* As a **Site User** I want to be able to...
  * ...**Create a post** so that I can **make my post accessible for other users.**
  * ...**Comment on a post** so that I can **be involved in the discussion.**
  * ...**Modify or delete a comment on a post** so that I can **update my public opinion should it ever change.**
  * ...**View comments** so that I can **view comments on an individual post so that I can read the conversation.**

##### **EPIC 6 - Admin and Site Management:**

* As a **Store Owner** I want to be able to...
  * ...**Manage Posts** so that I can **create, read, update and delete posts so that I can manage the sites content.**

### **Wireframes**

I used Balsamiq Wireframes to help me with my design process for this project.

Desktop Wireframes:

Mobile Wireframes:

![Screenshot of mobile wireframes](docs/images/balsamiq-mobile-wireframes.png)

<hr>

### **UX Flow Chart**

In order to help me visualise the basic logic of how the site will work and for the user to have a smooth experience, I created the following flow chart during the planning stages using [draw.io's flow chart maker](https://app.diagrams.net/):

![UX planning flow chart](docs/images/game-talk-flowchart.png)

### **Database Schema**
I used [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/) to help visualise my database tables. See the image below:

![Database Schema](docs/images/drawsql-diagram.png)

<hr>

### **Colour Scheme**
After researching various options for this project, I opted for the colour scheme below:
![Colour Palette](docs/images/colour-pallette.png)

I did not end up using all of the colours because i believe the site looks a lot more cleaner with a few less colours.

<hr>

#### **Typography**

I researched a few different fonts that I thought would fit the sites theme. I eventually decided on:

*[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
I chose Roboto for its simplicity so the site is readible, also the font reminds of my text you see in Video Games which fits perfectly for the site.

## Agile Development

I used Github projects to create and track issues and User Stories. The Agile processes and methodologies can be viewed [here](/AGILE.md)

# **Features**

## **Site Navigation**

### **Admin Page**

The Admin Page was setup right at the start of the project as it is crucial to provide the site with test data and users to the project.

![Screenshot of admin page](docs/images/admin-page.png)

<hr>

### **Navbar**
â€‹
The Navbar is a bootstrap component which allows users to navigate around the site with ease. 

![Screenshot of navbar](docs/images/nav-bar.png)

When the user is logged out they are unable to create a post. Upon clicking the "Create Post" option on the navbar the user will be told to "Log in to create a post."

The Navbar has been edited to display properly on smaller screens using bootstrap:

iPhone:

![Screenshot of iPhone navbar](docs/images/nav-bar-phone.png)

iPad:

![Screenshot of iPad navbar](docs/images/nav-bar-ipad.png)

<hr>

<hr>

### Social Media Links

The social media icons are situated at the bottom of the page on the Footer. The Social Media links are functional and will open in a new tab. 
**NOTE:** There is no actual Social Media Content for this site at the time of writing.

![Screenshot of social media links](docs/images/social-links.png)

<hr>

### **Home Page**

The Home Page uses a background image that shows people playing games on computers, this was chosen due to its relevance to the site. The home page is where the paginated list of
video game posts created by the users of the site or an admin will be displayed. Each video game post is a card displaying the image they provided for the game, the title, the beginning of the description, when it was created and the user it was created by. If the user who created the post does not provide an image there is a default image that will appear which says "no image available"

No image available image:

![Screenshot of no image available](docs/images/no-image-available.png)

Home Page:

![Screenshot of Home Page](docs/images/home-page.png)

The Home Page is responsive and works well on any device. The user can search for games using the search box on the navbar. This is how it looks on an iPhone:

![Screenshot of iPhone home page](docs/images/home-page-iphone.png)

and an Ipad:

![Screenshot of iPad navbar](docs/images/home-page-ipad.png)

<hr>

### **About Page**

The About Page explains the benefits of users registering an account and getting involved with the website, wether that be by creating posts themselfs or commenting on other users posts and getting involved in the discussion.

![Screenshot of About Page](docs/images/about-page.png)

<hr>

### **Create Post Page** 

If the user who selects the "Create Post" page is not logged in they will be presented with "Log in to create a post."

![Screenshot of create post not logged in](docs/images/create-post-not-logged-in.png)

If the user who selects the "Create Post" page is logged in they will be presented with a form with multiple different sections that the user can fill out to create a post.

![Screenshot of create post page](docs/images/create-post-page.png)

<hr>

### **Game Page**

Once the user clicks on a post from the home page they will be navigated to the post they selected and shown all the details that the user who created the post entered. Along with the date and time the post was made and the name of the user who created it.

![Screenshot of post page](docs/images/post-page.png)

If the user scrolls down the page they will see the Comment section that registered users can use to post comments, delete their own comments or edit them.

![Screenshot of comment section](docs/images/comment-section.png)

<hr>

### **Allauth Account Pages**

All account pages use the same background as the home and about page to match the theme of the website.

#### Sign Up

I used allauth to handle the account pages for the project. In order to register, the User must complete the form on the Signup Page which they get navigated to by clicking Register on the Nav Bar.

![Screenshot of signup page](docs/images/sign-up-page.png)

Phone:

![Screenshot of iPhone signup page](docs/images/sign-up-page-phone.png)

Once the user has successfully registered, they will be logged in and taken to the Home Page. The form will display error messages in several circumstances:

* The user chooses a Username that is already taken
* The password is not long enough
* The passwords do not match

<hr>

#### Log In

Existing Users can log in by clicking the Log In button on the Nav Bar. This will bring them to the Log In Page:

![Screenshot of log in page](docs/images/sign-in-page-phone.png)

If the log in details are not valid an error message will be displayed.

Phone:

![Screenshot of iPhone sign in page](docs/images/sign-in-page-phone.png)

<hr>

#### Log Out

To log out of the site and end the current session, the User can navigate to Logout in the Nav Bar.

![Screenshot of logout page](docs/images/sign-out-page.png)

The user can confirm by clicking the "Sign Out" button or cancel by going back to another page. If the user chooses to log out, they are redirected to the Home Page and a success message informs them they have been logged out:

![Screenshot of signout confirmation](docs/images/sign-out-confirmation.png)

<hr>

## Messages

User feedback is provided by success messages with the aim of providing a more involved User Experience. These messages are dismissible by clicking the 'X':

**Successful Login**

![Screenshot of succesful login message](docs/images/successfully-sign-in.png)

**Successful add Game Post message**

![Screenshot of successful add game post message](docs/images/successful-add-game-post-message.png)

**Successful Comment Submission**

![Screenshot of successful comment submission](docs/images/succesful-comment.png)

**Successful Comment Deletion**

![Screenshot of successful comment deletion](docs/images/comment-deleted-message.png)

<hr>

## Defensive Design

In order to avoid the user unintentionally deleting their own content, some simple defensive design programming was implemented. If a User is logged in and clicks delete on one of their reviews, they will be prompted for confirmation:

![Screenshot of deletion confirmation](docs/images/deletion-comment-message.png)

<hr>

## **Future Enhancements**

There are a number of areas with scope for future improvement. This project has been challenging and ultimately the project deadline was fast approaching. There is potential to add the following:

* The ability to view Users profiles and all the posts they have created.
* The ability for Users to comment on other Users profiles to begin discussions with them.
* The ability for Users to be able to edit their own profile with a profile picture, bio etc.
* The ability for Users to be able to like another Users post.

<hr>

## **Testing Phase**

The testing process, along with bugs, can be viewed [here](/TESTING.md)

<hr>

## **Deployment**

The deployment was a fairly lengthy process so I have detailed it in a seperate file. It can be found [here](/DEPLOYMENT.md)

The final deployment can be viewed [here](https://gametalk-11995ffc1877.herokuapp.com/)

<hr>

## **Software and Tech**

The following software and tech was used:

- [BootStrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) to provide key components such as the navbar and cards.
- CSS to provide custom styling in addition to Bootstrap.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) as a Python framework to develop the project.
- [Django all auth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) used to handle user authentication.
- [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/) to develop the logic for the project.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) to provide icons.
- GitHub as my version control for the site.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to deploy the project.
- HTML - The base language to create templates for the site.
- JavaScript - only used once, for the edit and delete button on comments.
- Python - Installed packages can be found in the requirements.txt file.
- [Summernote](https://summernote.org/) to provide a WYSIWYG text editor in the admin area.
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) to source the background image for the site.
