# Agile

## Overview

The Agile planning methodology was used during the development of Game Talk. This was my first experience approaching a project using this methodology and i encountered a few challenges along the way. Before this project i had successfully developed other applications with a different approach, no use of GitHub Projects, Boards etc.

Initially, I struggled to adapt to the new methodology and found it challenging and confusing to organise and plan as an invidual developer. As a result of this confusion, i made a lot of planning errors while developing my SQL Database Schema, Flow Chart etc.

## Benefits of the Agile approach

As I moved through the initial stages of the project, I began to recognise the real benefits of Agile.

An example of this is being able to use the "Projects" tab on github where i can create User Stories to keep track of what i am currently doing and what i plan on doing next. Wether that task is focusing on the front end of the site, like css and html or the back end of the site, like handling data. It allows you to keep a structured workflow because you have an order to follow to complete the overall project.

It is easy to imagine how multiple developers pulling, branching, and working on these steps at the same time can rapidly produce impressive and satisfying results and how being able to view such progress would be good for team morale.

Using agile helped me focus on one task at a time and I genuinely believe the project benefitted overall from using this methodology.
